WHAT IS A TREE?
A tree is a non-linear data structure that stores and organises data in a herarchial order.

Root → The topmost node of the hierarchy is called the root of the tree.
Child → Nodes next in the hierarchy are the children of the previous node.
Parent → The node just previous to the current node is the parent of the current node.
Siblings → Nodes with the same parent are called siblings.
Ancestors → Nodes which are higher in the hierarchy are ancestors of a given node.
Descendents → Nodes which are lower in the hierarchy are descendants of a given node.
Internal Nodes → Nodes with at least one child are internal nodes.
External Nodes/Leaves → Nodes which don't have any child are called leaves of a tree.
Edge → The link between two nodes is called an edge.
Level → The root of a tree is at level 0 and the nodes whose parent is root are at level 1 and so on.


trees can be represented using two ways:
1) list representation(array):
In this representation, we use two types of nodes one for representing the node with data
and another for representing only references. We start with a node with data from root node
in the tree. Then it is linked to an internal node through a reference node and is linked to any
other node directly. This process repeats for all the nodes in the tree. T


2)linked list represnation:
we use left node as well as right node for represting left and right subtrees

TYPES OF TREES:

->A tree in which every node can have a maximum of two children is called as Binary Tree.

->A binary tree in which every node has either two or zero number of children is called Strictly Binary Tree

->Strictly binary tree is also called as Full Binary Tree or Proper Binary Tree or 2-Tree

->A binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at same level is called Complete Binary Tree.

->Complete binary tree is also called as Perfect Binary Tree

->An AVL tree is a balanced binary search tree. In an AVL tree, balance factor of every node is either -1, 0 or +1.

->Balance factor of a node is the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees of that node

->B-Tree is a self-balanced search tree with multiple keys in every node and more than two children for every node.

->Splay tree is another variant of binary search tree. In a splay tree, the recently accessed element is placed at the root of the tree

->Red Black Tree is a Binary Search Tree in which every node is colored eigther RED or BLACK
